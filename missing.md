User Authentication & Authorization: This entire feature set, which was a core part of both the frontend and backend plans (Phase 1, Task 2 on both), is completely missing. There are no login/signup pages, no auth routes on the backend, and no JWT handling.
Admin CRUD Operations: The plan specified creating/updating buildings and rooms from the frontend, which is not implemented. The backend is also missing the corresponding POST endpoints.
Additionally, there are a few minor bugs and inconsistencies between the frontend and backend, particularly regarding data types and real-time event names.
Detailed Analysis and Proposed Changes
Here is a breakdown of how the code fulfills, or deviates from, the implementation plan, along with the necessary code changes to address the issues.
Backend Analysis
Phase 1 (Setup and Core API):
Fulfills: Project setup with Express and Prisma, modular structure, database migrations, and a seeding script are all correctly implemented.
Deviates: Authentication/Authorization is missing. Core CRUD APIs for creating buildings and rooms are also missing.
Phase 2 (Business Logic):
Fulfills: This is the strongest part of the implementation. The AllocationService, rebalancing logic, atomic updates via Prisma transactions, and optimistic locking via a version field are all implemented exactly as planned.
Phase 3 (Performance, Security, Testing):
Fulfills: Caching with Redis (via Upstash REST API), security headers with helmet, rate-limiting, input validation with express-validator, and unit tests for the allocation service are all present and correctly implemented.
Phase 4 (Deployment & Documentation):
Deviates: Docker files are missing. A README.md for the backend is also missing.
Frontend Analysis
Phase 1 (Foundation and Core UI):
Fulfills: The project is set up with Vite and React Router. State is managed with React Context (a reasonable alternative to the proposed Zustand). The component structure is excellent.
Deviates: User Authentication is completely missing.
Phase 2 (Feature Development):
Fulfills: Student Management (CRUD), the Interactive Seat Map, and the Allocation Planning page are all fully implemented and work well.
Deviates: The UI for creating/managing buildings and rooms is not present.
Phase 3 (Real-time Features):
Fulfills & Exceeds: The optional real-time seat map updates via Socket.io have been successfully implemented. This is a great feature.
